    <h1>Nikita Tsarev <small class="mono">@tsarn</small></h1>

    <p>
      Soo my name is Nikita. I currently am a third-year computer science
      student at SPbSU. I was born and live in Russia and I've
      enjoyed programming and tech stuff since I was a kid.
    </p>

    <p>
      In school I did quite a bit of competitive programming,
      check out my <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/TsarN">Codeforces profile</a>.
      I've also taught at my <a href="http://olimp-nw.narod.ru">local summer computer school</a>,
      you can check out some of the related projects <a href="https://github.com/CSchool">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <p>
      I went through my GitHub and ooh boy there's a lot of old stuff in there.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/azul-research/jdk-riscv">OpenJDK RISC-V port</a></strong>.
      I and several other students tried to port OpenJDK's HotSpot JVM
      to run on RISC-V on Linux. It was my second year in university
      and other students were using this project for their thesis.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/TsarN/pygon">Pygon</a></strong>.
      Pygon is a console application designed to make it easier to prepare programming contests.
      It addresses some gripes I (and many others apparently) have with <a
        href="https://polygon.codeforces.com">Polygon</a>.
      Note, that Pygon isn't related to Polygon in any way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/TsarN/invoke">Invoke</a></strong>.
      A tool for running submissions in a secure programming contest environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/TsarN/codehighp">CodeHighp</a></strong>.
      Esoteric programming contests platform.
      I didn't really intend for it to be open source, there are
      no docs and code is a bit of a mess (really, just a bit).
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice a pattern yet?
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/TsarN/lfs-util">Gross</a></strong>.
      A package mananager for Linux From Scratch written in Bash.
      I was fifteen at the time, give me a break.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://github.com/TsarN/uber-os">UberOS</a></strong>
      Yeah, this one is weird. Unix-like operating system for ComputerCraft.
      Virtual File System is named fsd and other artifacts
      that come with not really knowing how operating systems work.
      Also it's Lua all the way down.
    </p>

    <h2>Smaller projects</h2>

    <p>
      I haven't released source code for these,
      mostly because there's no value in it. Most of it is quick and dirty
      and was written in a day, never to be used again.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://tsarn.itch.io/cant-roll">Can't Roll, Can't Control</a></strong>.
      A puzzle game written in under 48 hours for a game jam.
      People seem to like it, but voting period is not over yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://tsarn.itch.io/cutout">Cutout</a></strong>.
      A puzzle game written in a week for a game jam.
      First place in game design, second place in fun and innovation.
      Among 709 entries. Whew.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong><a href="https://t.me/PlayCodenamesBot">@PlayCodenamesBot</a></strong>.
      Play Codenames with friends!
      In Russian. Via Telegram.
      Yeah, in hindsight this is
      not really practical.
